# 🎯 Learning GoPhish for Email Phishing Simulation

This repository documents my learning process using [GoPhish](https://github.com/gophish/gophish?tab=readme-ov-file), an open-source phishing simulation tool.

## 📌 What I'm Doing

I'm currently learning how to use GoPhish to send phishing emails to target email addresses in a controlled environment. My focus includes:

- Setting up and editing the **Sending Profile**
- Creating custom **Email Templates**
- Designing fake **Landing Pages**
- Launching **Phishing Campaigns**
- Monitoring clicks and submitted data from targets

## ⚠️ Important

This project is for **educational purposes only**. All tests are conducted in a **safe and isolated environment** using dummy or authorized email addresses.

## 🚧 Work In Progress

I'm still improving my understanding of phishing techniques through GoPhish features.
